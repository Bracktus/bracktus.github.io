		<p>I use spotify, I think it’s a pretty good service. I’ve tried 3 different forms of spotify on my system.</p>
  <ol type="1">
  <li>Using the official desktop app</li>
  <li>Using spotifyd (spotify premium only)</li>
  <li>Using ncspot (spotify premium only)</li>
  </ol>
  <p>The desktop app is pretty decent. It comes with desktop notifications and just works out of the box. If you dislike the look of it you can use <a href="https://github.com/khanhas/spicetify-cli">spicetify</a> to customise it. This include changing the colours and layout of the client. Removing uneccesary features and even injecting additional functionality.</p>
  <p><a href="https://github.com/Spotifyd/spotifyd">spotifyd</a> is a spotify daemon. Basically it’s an instance of spotify that runs in the background. It’s super lightweight so it doesn’t come with a client. You’ll need to install one like <a href="https://github.com/Rigellute/spotify-tui">spotify-tui</a> or just use your phone with spotify connect to queue songs. It doesn’t come with desktop notifications so you can use the spotify API or <a href="https://github.com/altdesktop/playerctl">playerctl</a> to create your own.</p>
  <p>Here’s a link to <a href="https://rchu.cc/examples/spotify/notif.py">my script</a> if you wanna see how I did it.</p>
  <p><a href="https://github.com/hrkfdn/ncspot">ncspot</a> is what I currently use. It’s a ncurses spotify client. It’s lightweight and runs in your terminal. Like spotifyd it doesn’t come with desktop notification so you’ll need to use the method above to add them.</p>
  <p>You can customise the colours and <em>some</em> of the keybindings in <code>~/.config/ncspot/config.toml</code>. I’ve set up some global keybinds with playerctl that pause/resume skip and rewind.</p>
  <p>Check <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Spotify">this</a> out for more more info on spotify on linux.</p>
