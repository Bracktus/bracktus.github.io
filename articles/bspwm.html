<div class="article-content">
	<p><a href="https://github.com/baskerville/bspwm">bspwm</a> is a manual tiling window manager (WM).</p>
 <p>Basically when you open a new window the WM decides the size and position of the window. Tiling means that none of the windows overlap, they ‘tile’ next to each other in a sort of grid formation. There are many great tiling window managers out there but I use bspwm.</p>
 <p>When bspwm starts up it runs a script named <code>bspwmrc</code>. It’s a bash script where you can run commands to change the look and feel of bspwm. You can also place some startup commands in it.</p>
 <div class="note">
 <p>Note: bspwm doesn’t come with a way to control it. i.e None of your keys will work You’ll need to install a hotkey daemon (software that runs in the background) such as sxhkd to manipulate windows.</p>

 <h2 id="so-what-is-it-doing">So what is it doing?</h2>
 <p><code>bspc monitor -d I II III IV V</code></p>
 <p>This creates 5 workspaces that I can switch between. You can have up to 10 workspaces however I choose to use 5.</p>
 <pre><code>
 #Spacing
 bspc config border\_width         5
 bspc config window\_gap          12
 bspc config top\_padding         40
 </code></pre>
 <p>The first command sets the width of the borders around the windows, the second sets the gap between tiled windows</p>
 <p>The third command sets the padded space at the top of the screen. You'll want to set this if you have a bar or else the window will just cover it</p>
 <pre><code>
 #Misc
 bspc config split\_ratio          0.52
 bspc config borderless\_monocle   true
 bspc config gapless\_monocle      true
 </code></pre>
 <p>This first line sets the split ratio. This if you had 1 window and opened another this would decide what proportion of the screen the second window would occupy.</p>
 <h2 id="what-about-the-rest">What about the rest?</h2>
 <p>The remainder are startup commands. I'll try and cover these in another post</p>
