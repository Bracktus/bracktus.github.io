        <p><a href="https://github.com/baskerville/bspwm">bspwm</a> is a manual tiling window manager (WM).</p>
        <p>Basically when you open a new window the WM decides the size and position of the window. Tiling means that none of the windows overlap, they ‘tile’ next to each other in a sort of grid formation. There are many great tiling window managers out there but I use bspwm.</p>
        <p>When bspwm starts up it runs a script named <code>bspwmrc</code>. It’s a bash script where you can run commands to change the look and feel of bspwm. You can also place some startup commands in it.</p>
        <div class="note">
        <p>Note: bspwm doesn’t come with a way to control it. I.e None of your keys will work, you’ll need to install a hotkey daemon such as sxhkd to manipulate windows.</p>

        <p>This creates 5 workspaces that I can switch between. You can have up to 10 workspaces however I choose to use 5.</p>
        <pre><code>
        #Spacing
        bspc config border_width         5
        bspc config window_gap          12
        bspc config top_padding         40
        </code></pre>
        <p>The first command sets the width of the borders around the windows, the second sets the gap between tiled windows</p>
        <p>The third command sets the padded space at the top of the screen. You'll want to set this if you have a bar or else the window will just cover it</p>
        <pre><code>
        #Misc
        bspc config split_ratio          0.52
        bspc config borderless_monocle   true
        bspc config gapless_monocle      true
        </code></pre>
        <p>This first line sets the split ratio. This if you had 1 window and opened another this would decide what proportion of the screen the second window would occupy.</p>
        <h2 id="what-about-the-rest">What about the rest?</h2>
        <p>The remainder are startup commands. I'll try and cover these in another post</p>
