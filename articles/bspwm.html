<div class="article-content">
<p><a href="https://github.com/baskerville/bspwm">bspwm</a> is a manual tiling window manager (WM).</p>
<p>Basically when you open a new window the WM decides the size and position of the window. Tiling means that none of the windows overlap, they ‘tile’ next to each other in a sort of grid formation. There are many great tiling window managers out there but I use bspwm.</p>
<p>When bspwm starts up it runs a script named <code>bspwmrc</code>. It’s a bash script where you can run commmands to change the look and feel of bspwm. You can also place some startup commands in it.</p>
<span class="note"><p>Note: bspwm doesn’t come with a way to control it. i.e None of your keys will work You’ll need to install a hotkey deamon (software that runs in the background) such as sxhkd to manipulate windows.</p></span>
<h4>Here’s mine</h4>
<div class="highlight"><pre>
<span class="ch">#!/bin/sh</span>
bspc monitor -d I II III IV V

<span class="c1"># Spacing</span>
bspc config border_width         <span class="m">5</span>
bspc config window_gap          <span class="m">12</span>
bspc config top_padding         <span class="m">40</span>

<span class="c1"># Misc</span>
bspc config split_ratio          <span class="m">0.52</span>
bspc config borderless_monocle   <span class="nb">true</span>
bspc config gapless_monocle      <span class="nb">true</span>

</pre></div>
<h4>So what is it doing?</h4>
<p><code>bspc monitor -d I II III IV V</code></p>
<p>This creates 5 workspaces that I can switch between. You can have up to 10 workspaces however I choose to use 5.</p>

<div class=multi-code>
<span class="c1"># Spacing</span>
<br>bspc config border_width&emsp; &emsp;<span class="m">5</span>
<br>bspc config window_gap&emsp; &emsp;	<span class="m">12</span>
<br>bspc config top_padding&emsp; &emsp;<span class="m">40</span>
</div>
<p>The first command sets the width of the borders around the windows, the second sets the gap between tiled windows</p>
<p>The third command sets the padded space at the top of the screen. You'll want to set this if you have a bar or else the window will just cover it</p>

<div class=multi-code>
<span class="c1"># Misc</span>
<br>bspc config split_ratio&emsp; &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;<span class="m">0.52</span>
<br>bspc config borderless_monocle&emsp;&emsp;<span class="nb">true</span>
<br>bspc config gapless_monocle&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;  <span class="nb">true</span>
</span></p>
</div>
<p>This first line sets the split ratio. This if you had 1 window and opened another this would decide what proportion of the screen the second window would occupy.</p>

<h4>What about the rest?</h4>
<p>The remainder are startup commands. I'll try and cover these in another post</p>
