        <p>I’ve been using the Moonlander keyboard for about a week now and I want to share my thoughts on it. I bought it mid February, it was then built and shipped over here in early March. It took about 2 days for it to travel from Taiwan over to the UK. The time taken from clicking ‘purchase’ and having it in my hands was roughly 2 weeks.</p>
        <p>This is my first mechanical keyboard, I’ve been using a Corsair K30 for a few years now and it’s served me well. However, over the internet and real life I’ve heard nothing but praise for clicky switches. After looking at reviews, guides and wiki pages on switches, keycaps and form factors I decided on a ZSA Moonlander.</p>
        <p>The Moonlander is a Split Ortholinear keyboard.</p>
        <p>Split means that the keyboard is split into two halves, with a wire connecting them together.</p>
        <p>Ortholinear means that the keys are arranged in a matrix layout. On a normal QWERTY keyboard the keys are staggered and are arranged like bricks in a wall.</p>
        <h2 id="general-thoughts">General thoughts</h2>
        <p>I’ve used it for a few days now and I’m really enjoying the experience. The form factor allows you to place your hands wherever you want, it also allows you to unplug one side when gaming to decrease the amount of desk space it takes up. The general aesthetic of it is nice as well, I opted for the white version and it looks very clean and modern.</p>
        <p>I went with Cherry MX Blue switches, they’re quite nice to type on. The tactile feeling is great but they are quite loud which may be an issue if you’re using it at work or school.</p>
        <p>I haven’t found the wrist rest very useful. In fact, using it makes me feel more fatigued after a long typing session. Luckily, you can detach them or just fold them behind the keyboard.</p>
        <p>One issue I’ve had is that it doesn’t come with outer legs. This is actually a common complaint online as quite a lot of people want to tent the board. Tenting refers to titling the board in the Y axis so that your hands are angled when typing. You can buy another set of legs from their website, or you 3D print your own set. The issue I’m having is that it can tilt down when pressing keys in the top left/right corners. This isn’t a huge issue as most of the time I’m not pressing hard enough to tilt it down.</p>
        <p>The thumb keys are great as well. You can reach the first 2 white keys easily but the big red one and the last white one require a bit of a reach. A major upside to it is the fact that you can remap keys.</p>
        <h2 id="the-oryx-software">The Oryx software</h2>
        <p>When you receive your Moonlander, one of the first things you should do is check out Oryx.</p>
        <p>Oryx is a web application that allows you to remap every key on the Moonlander, it also has loads of configuration options to create a really efficient/ergonomic setup.</p>
        <p>I’ve remapped some commonly pressed keys to be easier to access. For example I’ve moved tab over to the caps lock key. The space, escape, backspace and return key now reside on the white thumb keys.</p>
        <p>I’ve spent a lot of time tinkering with my layout and will likely continue doing so for a while, some features that I’ve been using include layers, tap dance and mouse controls.</p>
        <h3 id="layers">Layers</h3>
        <p>Layers allow you to switch your entire layout at a single key press. I’ve added buttons to switch to layers that:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Move the numbers to the home row</li>
        <li>Allow easy access to my window manager hotkeys</li>
        <li>Move the arrow keys to hjkl</li>
        </ul>
        <p>They take a while to get used to, but they allow you to spend a lot more time on the home row and reduces the amount of stretching to access symbols and shortcuts.</p>
        <p>If you’re worried about not knowing which layer you’re on then you can add per-layer RGB lighting. It’s helpful during the earlier stages to remind you where you are.</p>
        <h3 id="tap-dance">Tap Dance</h3>
        <p>Tap Dance lets you assign up to four functions to one key.</p>
        <p>You can assign them to:</p>
        <ol type="1">
        <li>On tap</li>
        <li>On hold</li>
        <li>On double tap</li>
        <li>On hold + tap</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Personally, I’ve only used 1 and 2 and it’s been brilliant.</p>
        <p>I’ve moved <strong>shift</strong> onto <strong>A</strong> so I don’t need to move my pinkie to capitalise letters and moved <strong>ctrl</strong> to <strong>;</strong> for the same reason.</p>
        <p>When I need to do <strong>shift+A</strong> or <strong>ctrl+;</strong> I’ve assigned a second set just below them on the <strong>Z</strong> and <strong>/</strong> .</p>
        <p>To trigger them I just need to hold it for a bit longer. This introduces a slight delay when pressing these keys normally but after a while I just got used to it.</p>
        <h3 id="mouse-controls">Mouse Controls</h3>
        <p>These allow you to control the mouse using the keyboard. This includes clicking, mouse buttons and scrolling.</p>
        <p>They’re ok for quick tasks but with anything complicated you’ll find yourself reaching for a mouse.</p>
        <h2 id="transition-from-a-normal-keyboard">Transition from a normal keyboard</h2>
        <p>I normally type around 60wpm. When I first switched over to the Moonlander, I dropped down to 20wpm.</p>
        <p>I’m currently typing around 40wpm after a few days of usage. This drops off by a lot when programming due to all the symbols involved.</p>
        <p>I can still type on a regular keyboard moderately fast and I don’t think that’ll change.</p>
        <h1 id="final-thoughts">Final thoughts</h1>
        <p>I paid £261 for it and £40 for shipping. It’s a pricey piece of kit but I think it’s worth it for the customisability and ergonomics.</p>
