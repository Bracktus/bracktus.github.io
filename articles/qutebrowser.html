        <p><a href="https://qutebrowser.org/">qutebrowser</a> is a browser.</p>
        <p>What makes it different from other browsers like chrome or firefox is that it’s entirely keyboard based. You can navigate the web without ever touching the mouse resulting in a fast and smooth experience.</p>
        <p>It’s also really customisable. You can change the look and feel of it in python config file. This includes adding custom scripts that you can bind to a button. For example integrating a password manager, adding chromecast support or viewing videos in mpv.</p>
        <p>It’s a really nice experience, however it does have some issues.</p>
        <ol type="1">
        <li>No extentions</li>
        <li>You can’t do everything without a mouse</li>
        </ol>
        <h2 id="extentions">Extentions</h2>
        <p>No extentions means no ‘https everywhere’, no ‘ublock origin’ or tracking protection. This really sucks, especially the adblocking.</p>
        <p>Qutebrowser comes with a list of hosts that serves ads and blocks them. However, this doesn’t cover all ads and it doesn’t cover YouTube ads.</p>
        <h2 id="mouseless">Mouseless?</h2>
        <p>A lot of websites have interactive javascript and you can’t interact with them using the keybinds. You’ll find yourself reaching for the mouse in certain situations. It isn’t a huge issue but it is annoying.</p>
        <p>Overall I think that it’s still a great browser but the lack of extentions is an problem. Also there’s a massive learning curve before you’ll be productive within it.</p>
        <p>If you want a similar experience on firefox or chromium check out the <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/vimium-c/">vimium</a> extention.</p>
