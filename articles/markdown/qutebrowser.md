[qutebrowser](https://qutebrowser.org/) is a browser.

What makes it different from other browsers like chrome or firefox is that it's entirely keyboard based. You can navigate the web without ever touching the mouse resulting in a fast and smooth experience.

It's also really customisable. You can change the look and feel of it in python config file. This includes adding custom scripts that you can bind to a button. For example integrating a password manager, adding chromecast support or viewing videos in mpv.

It's a really nice experience, however it does have some issues. 

1. No extentions
2. You can't do everything without a mouse

## extentions

No extentions means no 'https everywhere', no 'ublock origin' or tracking protection. This really sucks, especially the adblocking. 

Qutebrowser comes with a list of hosts that serves ads and blocks them. However, this doesn't cover all ads and it doesn't cover YouTube ads. 

## mouseless?

A lot of websites have interactive javascript and you can't interact with them using the keybinds. You'll find yourself reaching for the mouse in certain situations. It isn't a huge issue but it is annoying.

Overall I think that it's still a great browser but the lack of extentions is an problem. Also there's a massive learning curve before you'll be productive within it. 

If you want a similar experience on firefox or chromium check out the [vimium](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/vimium-c/) extention.
